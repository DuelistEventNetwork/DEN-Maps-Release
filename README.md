## Features

### Maps

This mod adds 8 completely new maps to the game which can feature multiple arenas, depending on the map. They can be found and traveled to via the in-game map menu. Almost every map has a 2v2 version as well. 

ðŸ”¸Seaside Arena<br/>
ðŸ”¸Lava Bridge<br/>
ðŸ”¸Observatory<br/>
ðŸ”¸Dueling Square<br/>
ðŸ”¸Snowy Outpost<br/>
ðŸ”¸Crumbling Island<br/>
ðŸ”¸Crystal Lake<br/>
ðŸ”¸Eternal City Courtyard<br/>
ðŸ”¸Grand Library<br/>

### Items & Quality-of-Life

Here's a quick summary of the various Quality-of-Life features and items you can find on our maps

ðŸ”¸ **Starting Arrow Stones**: Every arena features interactable stones next to their entrances that fire a starting arrow. This can be used to coordinate when a match starts.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **Respawning in 2v2 Arenas**: Dying in a 2v2 arena will revive you in a similar fashion to how United Combat does in the vanilla game. It has been designed a bit differently to avoid spawn-killing and other issues.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **2v2 Match Timer**: Using a starting arrow stone on a 2v2 map will additionally start a 5 minute timer, with a 30 seconds remaining warning and a second projectile to indicate when the match ends.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **Multi-map play**: The map is usable at all times in this mod, and doesn't require a vote for players to travel. Players can exist between multiple maps at once in the same session without any of the usual desync issues.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **No Seamless Rot**: Seamless Co-op has a PvE balance feature where subsequent deaths builds up "Rot". A series of special items that stack various debuffs on your character which are only cleared upon resting a grace. Since this is a PvP mod, this feature is disabled for obvious QoL reasons.

ðŸ”¸ **Item: Braid of Marika**: Use this item to toggle on/off automatic revival on death.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **Regressive Grease**: Use this item to quickly and on-demand fully heal and restore your character to it's normal state, a bit like using a grace.<br/>
ðŸ”¸ **O'Jar of Plenty**: Use this item to toggle on/off infinite usage of goods.<br/>

ðŸ”¸ **More to come**: There's a lot more features we are actively working on to improve the player experience, add new gamemodes and improve existing ones
